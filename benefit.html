    <h3>Why solar?</h3>
    <p id="r1">
      There are many benefits to installing solar panels in your home. They 
      are becoming more and more affordable as
      time goes on, resulting in saved money. Even when your town or 
      neighborhood loses power, if you have solar
      panels,your power will stay on because solar panels aren't based on 
      the same non-renewable energy as most power
      systems.

        Environmental Benefits: Solar energy is a clean and renewable 
        energy source, meaning it doesn't produce greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants during operation. By using solar power, you can            significantly reduce your carbon footprint and contribute to mitigating climate change.
