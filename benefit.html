      <h3>Why solar?</h3>
      <p id="intro">
        There are many benefits to installing solar panels in your home. They
        are becoming more and more affordable as
        time goes on, resulting in saved money. Even when your town or
        neighborhood loses power, if you have solar
        panels,your power will stay on because solar panels aren't based on
        the same non-renewable energy as most power
        systems.

    <div class="reason_1">
      <p class="r1">
        Environmental Benefits: Solar energy is a clean and renewable
        energy source, meaning it doesn't produce greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants during operation. By using
        solar power, you can significantly reduce your carbon footprint and contribute to mitigating climate change.

     <div class="reason_2">
      <p class="r2">
       Cost Savings: While the initial investment in solar panels and installation may seem high, solar systems can lead to substantial long-term cost savings. Once installed, solar panels generate electricity from sunlight at no ongoing fuel cost, reducing or even eliminating your monthly electricity bills. Over time, the system can pay for itself and start generating savings.

    <div class="reason_3">
      <p class="r3">
       Increased Property Value: Homes equipped with solar panel systems tend to have higher property values and sell faster than those without. Many homebuyers are increasingly attracted to homes with solar installations due to the potential for reduced energy costs and environmental benefits, making your property more appealing in the real estate market.
