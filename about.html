    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>When you ask our founding team why we started SolarSavvy, we will respond with two words: Global Warming. It's getting worse every day. Melting ice caps. Poor air quality. Our electrical systems aren't helping either. Many people don't think about what goes into making electricity, but the truth is, some of the most harmful greenhouse gases are taken up when we make power grids, such as coal, oil, and gas. Solar panels use none of these things. They have zero air emissions, and the source that powers them, the sun, is very renewable. So why not save money on electricity and also help the environment?
