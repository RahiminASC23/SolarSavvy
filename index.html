    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Global Warming is getting worse every day. Worsening air quality. Heat waves. Melting ice caps. If we don't do something, earth may soon be inhabitable. That's why we created SolarSavvy. If it's easier to find solar panels, people will be more willing to buy them, making more people switch to renewable energy source</p>
